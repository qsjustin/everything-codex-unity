# /unity-workflow — Full Development Pipeline

Orchestrate a complete development workflow for: **$ARGUMENTS**

This command runs a 4-phase pipeline: **Clarify → Plan → Execute → Verify**. Each phase requires explicit user confirmation before proceeding to the next.

## Phase 1: Clarify

Interview the user to build a complete requirements picture. Ask about:

1. **Core mechanic / feature purpose** — what does it do? What problem does it solve?
2. **Target platform** — mobile (iOS/Android), desktop, WebGL, VR?
3. **Performance constraints** — target FPS? Memory budget? Draw call limit?
4. **Unity subsystems involved** — physics? UI? animation? audio? networking?
5. **Integration points** — what existing systems does this touch?
6. **Acceptance criteria** — how do we know it's done? What should we test?

Produce a **Requirements Summary** with all answers consolidated. Ask the user to confirm before proceeding.

If the user provided a detailed description in `$ARGUMENTS` and the requirements are clear, you may present the summary directly for confirmation rather than asking each question individually.

## Phase 2: Plan

Based on confirmed requirements:

1. **Scan the project** — use `unity-scout` (haiku) for fast codebase exploration: read CLAUDE.md, find relevant existing scripts, map assembly structure
2. **Identify subsystems** — which Unity packages and skills are involved?
3. **Assess complexity** using the model-routing skill heuristics:
   - Count estimated files to create/modify
   - Check for complexity keywords in the task description
   - Identify risk factors (serialization changes, networking, platform-specific, threading)
   - Rate as **simple** (1-2 files, no risk) / **moderate** (3-8 files, some risk) / **complex** (9+ files, high risk)
4. **Choose execution strategy** based on complexity:
   - **Simple** → `unity-coder-lite` (sonnet) — faster, cheaper
   - **Moderate** → `unity-coder` (opus) — deeper reasoning
   - **Complex** → multiple agents via `/unity-team`
   - **Specialized** → route to domain agent: `unity-prototyper`, `unity-ui-builder`, `unity-network-dev`, `unity-shader-dev`
5. **Generate implementation plan**:
   - Scripts to create/modify (with file paths and assembly placement)
   - Scene changes needed (GameObjects, components, physics layers)
   - Dependencies on existing systems
   - Risk areas (serialization, platform-specific, performance)
   - Estimated complexity and chosen agent tier with rationale

Present the plan to the user and wait for approval before executing.

## Phase 2b: Critic Review (optional)

Unless `--no-critic` is specified in the original arguments:

1. **Invoke `unity-critic`** (opus, read-only) with the approved plan
2. The critic will challenge the plan for Unity-specific gotchas, missed edge cases, over-engineering, and performance risks
3. Present the critic's challenges to the user
4. Incorporate valid challenges into the plan before executing
5. If no critical challenges are raised, proceed directly to Phase 3

## Phase 3: Execute

Follow the approved plan:

1. **Route to the appropriate agent(s)** based on the plan
2. **Write C# code** following all rules in `.claude/rules/`
3. **Set up scene elements** via MCP if needed (`batch_execute` for speed)
4. **Check console** via `read_console` after each major step for compilation errors
5. If errors are found, fix them before proceeding

Report progress at natural milestones (e.g., "Scripts written, setting up scene now...").

## Phase 4: Verify

Run the `unity-verifier` agent to perform a verify-fix loop:

1. **Review** all changed files against the unity-reviewer checklist
2. **Auto-fix** issues that are safe to fix automatically
3. **Re-verify** if fixes were applied (max 3 iterations)
4. **Run tests** via MCP if available

### Deslop Pass

After verification succeeds with no critical issues, perform a targeted code-bloat review on all files created or modified during this workflow. Specifically target:

1. **Unnecessary abstractions** — interfaces with one implementation, factory classes that create one type, wrapper classes that add no behavior
2. **Over-commenting** — comments that restate the code, obvious doc comments, commented-out code blocks
3. **Redundant error handling** — try/catch that just rethrows, null checks on values that can never be null, defensive code with no plausible failure mode
4. **Dead code** — unused private methods, unreachable branches, unused parameters
5. **Over-engineering** — generic solutions for non-generic problems, premature optimization patterns, unnecessary design patterns

Deslop rules:
- Only simplify, never add complexity
- Preserve all runtime behavior
- Do not touch code that existed before this workflow started
- If in doubt, leave it alone — false positives are worse than missed bloat
- Apply fixes directly, then re-check console via `read_console` to confirm no regressions

### Final Summary

Present a complete summary to the user:

```
## Workflow Complete

### What was built
- [list of features implemented]

### Files created/modified
- [file paths with brief descriptions]

### Verification results
- [auto-fixed issues]
- [remaining items for human review]

### Test results
- [compilation status, test pass/fail counts]

### Manual steps needed
- [any inspector assignments, scene references, etc.]

### How to test
- [step-by-step testing instructions]
```

## Design Principles

- **Each phase gate requires user confirmation** — never skip ahead
- **Prefer existing patterns** — match the project's established conventions
- **Minimal viable implementation** — don't overbuild on the first pass
- **Verify everything** — the verify phase is not optional
