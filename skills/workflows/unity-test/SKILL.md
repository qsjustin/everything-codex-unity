# /unity-test — Write and Run Tests

Write tests for the project and execute them via MCP.

## Scope

If the user specified a scope: test **$ARGUMENTS**
If no scope: identify the most critical untested code paths.

## Workflow

Use the `unity-test-runner` agent to:

### Step 1: Assess Test Coverage

1. Find existing test assemblies (`.asmdef` files with test references)
2. If no test assemblies exist, create them:
   - `ProjectName.Tests.Editor` — EditMode tests (fast, no scene)
   - `ProjectName.Tests.Runtime` — PlayMode tests (full lifecycle)
3. Identify scripts with public APIs that lack tests
4. Prioritize: gameplay logic > systems > utilities

### Step 2: Write Tests

For each untested class/method:
- **EditMode test** if it's pure logic (no MonoBehaviour lifecycle needed)
- **PlayMode test** if it involves MonoBehaviour, physics, or scene state
- Naming: `MethodName_Condition_ExpectedResult`
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Clean up GameObjects in TearDown

### Step 3: Run Tests

```
run_tests → execute all tests (or specific fixture if scoped)
read_console → get test results
```

### Step 4: Report

Present results:
- Total: X passed, Y failed, Z skipped
- For failures: test name, expected vs actual, stack trace, suggested fix
- New tests created: list with file paths
- Coverage gaps: what still needs testing

## Test Priority

1. **Game state logic** — health, damage, scoring, inventory
2. **Input processing** — movement calculation, ability activation
3. **Data systems** — save/load, serialization, configuration
4. **Edge cases** — zero health, empty inventory, null references
