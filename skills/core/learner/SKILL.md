# Learner — Knowledge Extraction

After resolving a non-trivial bug or discovering surprising behavior, use this skill to extract and preserve the learning. Not every fix is worth saving — apply the quality gates strictly.

## When to Invoke

Consider extraction when:
- A debugging session took more than 3 back-and-forth exchanges
- The root cause was surprising or counterintuitive
- The fix required understanding a project-specific convention or quirk
- You discovered an undocumented interaction between systems

## Quality Gates

ALL three gates must pass. If any fails, do not save the learning.

### Gate 1: Not Googleable
Could someone find this answer with a 5-minute web search?

- **Fails:** "Use CompareTag instead of == for tag comparison" (standard Unity knowledge)
- **Fails:** "Cache GetComponent in Awake for performance" (well-documented best practice)
- **Passes:** "Our EventChannel ScriptableObjects must be in a Resources/ folder or they get stripped in IL2CPP builds because nothing in code holds a direct reference"
- **Passes:** "The CombatSystem processes damage in LateUpdate, not Update, so any health modification in Update will be overwritten"

### Gate 2: Codebase-Specific
Is this specific to THIS project's architecture, conventions, or quirks?

- **Fails:** "UniTask is better than coroutines" (generic advice)
- **Fails:** "VContainer uses constructor injection" (library documentation)
- **Passes:** "The InventorySystem expects item IDs to be registered in ItemRegistry before any InventoryModel is created — initialization order matters"
- **Passes:** "Scene transitions must go through SceneSystem.LoadAsync, not SceneManager directly, because SceneSystem handles LifetimeScope cleanup"

### Gate 3: Required Real Effort
Did this take actual debugging effort to discover?

- **Fails:** Missing semicolon, typo in field name, wrong import
- **Fails:** Obvious null reference from unassigned SerializeField
- **Passes:** Subtle race condition between async scene load and VContainer injection
- **Passes:** Serialization depth limit causing data truncation in nested inventory structure

## Classification

Categorize each learning as one of:

**Expertise** — Domain knowledge about WHY something works a certain way.
> "The damage formula in CombatSystem uses a lookup table because the designer wanted non-linear scaling curves that couldn't be expressed as a simple formula."

**Workflow** — Procedural knowledge about HOW to do something in this project.
> "To add a new enemy type: 1) Create SO in Assets/Data/Enemies from EnemyDefinition template, 2) Add entry to EnemyRegistry SO, 3) Create prefab variant from EnemyBase prefab, 4) Register in WaveSystem spawn table."

## Output Format

```markdown
### [Concise Title]
**Type:** expertise | workflow
**Context:** [what triggered the discovery — the bug, task, or question]
**Learning:** [the non-obvious knowledge, 1-3 sentences]
**Files:** [relevant file paths]
```

## Storage

Append the learning to the project's `AGENTS.md` file under a `## Project Learnings` section. If that section does not exist, create it at the end of the file.

Each entry is appended chronologically. Never overwrite or edit previous entries — they form a timeline of discoveries.

Session data is automatically recorded to `.codex-unity/state/learnings.jsonl` by the `auto-learn.sh` hook (strict profile). For pre-v1.3.0 projects, the file may be at `.codex-legacy/learnings.jsonl` instead.

## Pattern Categories

Each learning and session is assigned one of five categories. These categories are used by `/unity-learn extract` for pattern analysis.

| Category | Description | Signals |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **bug-fix** | Debugging session that resolved a defect | Recent commits contain "fix", "bug", "patch"; session focused on single files |
| **performance** | Optimization work | Files named with "pool", "cache", "optim"; profiler skills loaded |
| **architecture** | Structural changes to Models, Views, or Systems | Multiple MVS files edited; assembly definition changes |
| **workflow** | General feature development (default) | Balanced mix of file types; no dominant pattern |
| **integration** | Third-party or cross-system work | Shader files, package manifest edits, plugin code |

## Confidence Scoring

When reviewing accumulated learnings (via `/unity-learn extract`), patterns are scored by frequency:

| Level | Threshold | Interpretation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **High** | 3+ sessions | Well-established project pattern — safe to codify as a skill or rule |
| **Medium** | 2 sessions | Emerging pattern — worth noting, may need one more data point |
| **Low** | 1 session | Single observation — keep for context but don't act on yet |

High-confidence patterns are candidates for `/unity-learn draft-skill` or `/unity-skillify <topic>` to generate new skills automatically. The `/unity-skillify` command provides a more complete workflow with cross-referencing against existing skills, automatic category detection, and optional `--install` flag for direct placement.

## Anti-Patterns — Do NOT Save

- Generic Unity best practices (already covered by `.codex-legacy/rules/`)
- Standard library/package usage (read the docs instead)
- Temporary workarounds (these should be tracked as TODOs, not learnings)
- Obvious things ("MonoBehaviours must be attached to GameObjects")
- Preferences or style choices (already covered by `.codex-legacy/rules/csharp-unity.md`)
