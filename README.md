# everything-claude-unity

> **Fork note: everything-codex-unity**
>
> This repository is forked from [XeldarAlz/everything-claude-unity](https://github.com/XeldarAlz/everything-claude-unity). The body of this README intentionally preserves the upstream Claude-oriented documentation for attribution and easy comparison.
>
> This fork migrates the toolkit to Codex plugin/skill conventions:
> - Codex plugin manifest: `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
> - Codex skills and workflows: `skills/**/SKILL.md`
> - Unity MCP config: `.mcp.json`
> - Original Claude agents, commands, hooks, and rules are preserved as reference material under `.codex-legacy/`
> - Project instructions now use `AGENTS.md`; `CLAUDE.md` is no longer the active entry point in this fork
>
> **Two install modes:**
>
> - **Codex Desktop marketplace mode** (`--codex-marketplace`) installs a home-local plugin so Codex Desktop can discover `$unity-*` workflow skills from the skill picker/new sessions. It writes `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, installs the bundle at `~/plugins/everything-codex-unity/`, and enables `everything-codex-unity@everything-codex-unity` in `~/.codex/config.toml`.
> - **Project mode** (`--project-dir <UnityProject>`) installs project-local guidance, MCP config, templates, and legacy references into a Unity project. Use this for Codex CLI/project-context setup and for files that should live beside `Assets/` and `ProjectSettings/`. Project-local `skills/` are useful reference material, but Codex Desktop may not index them unless the toolkit is also installed through marketplace mode.
>
> `--project-dir` and `--codex-marketplace` are mutually exclusive. Run both commands separately if you need both Unity-project files and Codex Desktop `$unity-*` skill discovery.
>
> **Install into a Unity project:**
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/qsjustin/everything-codex-unity.git /tmp/ecu
> /tmp/ecu/install.sh --project-dir .
> ```
>
> `--project-dir` must point at the Unity project folder containing `Assets/` and `ProjectSettings/`. For repos shaped like `Repo/client/Assets`, run the installer with `--project-dir ./client`.
>
> **Upgrade project mode:**
>
> ```bash
> /tmp/ecu/upgrade.sh --project-dir .
> ```
>
> **Uninstall project mode:**
>
> ```bash
> /tmp/ecu/uninstall.sh --project-dir .
> ```
>
> **Register the Codex Desktop marketplace plugin:**
>
> ```bash
> /tmp/ecu/install.sh --codex-marketplace
> ```
>
> **Upgrade marketplace mode:**
>
> ```bash
> /tmp/ecu/upgrade.sh --codex-marketplace
> ```
>
> **Uninstall marketplace mode:**
>
> ```bash
> /tmp/ecu/uninstall.sh --codex-marketplace
> ```
>
> To use a non-default Codex home during testing or custom installs, add `--codex-home <path>` or set `CODEX_HOME`. Add `--no-backup` to uninstall commands if you want removal instead of backup directories.
>
> Marketplace install and uninstall update only the `everything-codex-unity` entry in `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`; other plugin entries are preserved. The JSON may be normalized by the updater, but unrelated plugin data is not removed. If the marketplace JSON is malformed, the command fails before moving or deleting the existing plugin bundle.
>
> `upgrade.sh` and `uninstall.sh` expect an existing install. If the project files or Desktop marketplace plugin are not present yet, run the matching `install.sh` command first.
>
> Keep or re-clone this repository when you need to run `upgrade.sh` later; marketplace install copies the plugin bundle into `~/plugins/everything-codex-unity/`, but upgrades still run from the source checkout.
>
> **Use with Codex Desktop:** after installation, restart Codex Desktop so it reloads `~/.codex/config.toml` and the local marketplace. Open the Unity project in Codex, type `$` in the composer, and choose skills such as `$unity-doctor`, `$unity-audit`, `$unity-workflow`, `$unity-prototype`, `$unity-test`, or `$unity-build`. You can also invoke them in natural language, for example: “use `$unity-doctor` to check this project” or “use `$unity-workflow` to implement an inventory feature.”
>
> If editor automation is needed, ensure Unity MCP is running at `http://localhost:8080/mcp`. The original `/unity-*` slash-command syntax documented below belongs to the upstream Claude version; this Codex fork uses `$unity-*` skill invocation.

**The ultimate Claude Code toolkit for Unity game development.**

A production-ready, plug-and-play system that gives Claude Code deep Unity expertise — from writing performant C# to building scenes, profiling performance, and triggering iOS/Android builds — all through natural language.

Built for **solo indie mobile game developers**. Drop it into any Unity project and it works.

### Why this works?

- **Drop-in, zero-config** — one `install.sh` and Claude Code knows Unity inside out
- **20 specialized agents** across haiku/sonnet/opus tiers with automatic complexity routing
- **22 safety hooks** that prevent scene/meta corruption, silent data loss, and GC spikes before they happen
- **MVS architecture built-in** — VContainer + MessagePipe + UniTask patterns enforced by rules and templates
- **MCP-native** — scene building, profiling, and iOS/Android builds triggered from chat
- **60+ automated tests** and reproducible benchmarks so the toolkit itself stays honest

| **Skills** | 41 | Knowledge modules for Unity systems, gameplay patterns, and mobile genres |
| **Hooks** | 22 | Safety net, quality gates, notifications, session persistence, auto-learning |
| **Rules** | 5 | C# coding standards, performance rules, MVS architecture patterns |
| **Scripts** | 8 | Validation tools for meta files, code quality, serialization, architecture |
| **Templates** | 10 | C# templates for MVS pattern (Model, View, System, LifetimeScope, Message) |
| **Tests** | 60+ | Automated test suite for hooks, state, cross-validation, templates, skills |
| **Benchmarks** | 4 | Quality evaluation scenarios with structural comparison |

---

## Highlights

### `/unity-workflow` — Full Development Pipeline

A structured 4-phase pipeline for any feature: **Clarify** requirements, **Plan** the implementation, **Execute** with specialized agents, **Verify** with automated review + fix loop.

```
/unity-workflow "add a combo scoring system with multipliers and visual feedback"
```

### `/unity-prototype` — One Prompt to Playable

Describe a mechanic, and Claude writes the C# scripts, builds the scene via MCP, sets up physics layers, configures the camera, and verifies it compiles.

```
/unity-prototype "2D platformer with wall jumping and dash"
```

### `/unity-ralph` — Relentless Verify-Fix Loop

Runs the verify-fix loop persistently — refuses to stop until the project is clean or hits the safety limit. Up to 30 effective verification passes with stall detection.

```
/unity-ralph --max-iterations 10
```

### `/unity-team` — Parallel Agent Orchestration

Spawn multiple agents simultaneously — coder + tester + reviewer working in parallel for faster development.

```
/unity-team --build "add health system with damage and healing"
/unity-team --security "audit the save system"
/unity-team --build --quick "add a basic score counter"
```

### What's New in v1.3.0

- **Smart Model Routing** — complexity heuristics auto-select haiku/sonnet/opus agents based on task signals
- **Persistent State** — session data survives reboots in `.claude/state/` with structured schema
- **Plan Critic** — `unity-critic` agent challenges your plans before execution (built into `/unity-workflow`)
- **Security Auditing** — `unity-security-reviewer` catches PlayerPrefs secrets, hardcoded keys, insecure saves
- **Benchmarking** — measure agent quality with reproducible evaluation scenarios
- **Skillify** — `/unity-skillify` auto-generates skills from your accumulated session learnings
- **Multi-channel Notifications** — Discord, Slack, OS-native with event filtering and rate limiting
- **Hardened CI** — cross-validation, tool restriction checks, template and skill quality gates

### Verify-Fix Loop

The `unity-verifier` agent automatically reviews your code changes, fixes safe issues (missing `[FormerlySerializedAs]`, uncached `GetComponent`, `?.` on Unity objects), and re-verifies — up to 3 iterations until clean. Built into `/unity-workflow` and available as an optional step in `/unity-feature` and `/unity-prototype`.

### Hook Profiles

Hooks are organized into three profiles. Set `UNITY_HOOK_PROFILE` to control which hooks run:

| Profile | What's Active | Best For |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| `minimal` | Safety hooks only (block scene/meta corruption, editor guards, pre-compact) | CI pipelines, experienced developers |
| `standard` | Safety + quality warnings + session persistence + stop validation (default) | Daily development |
| `strict` | Everything: GateGuard, cost tracking, auto-learning, build analysis | New projects, learning, auditing |

```bash
UNITY_HOOK_PROFILE=strict          # Enable all hooks including GateGuard
UNITY_HOOK_PROFILE=minimal         # Only critical safety hooks
DISABLE_UNITY_HOOKS=1              # Bypass all hooks entirely
UNITY_HOOK_MODE=warn               # Downgrade blocks to warnings
DISABLE_HOOK_BLOCK_SCENE_EDIT=1    # Disable a specific hook
```

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) installed
- Unity 2021.3 LTS or later
- [unity-mcp](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp) (optional but recommended for full pipeline)

### Install

```bash
# From your Unity project root:
git clone https://github.com/XeldarAlz/everything-claude-unity.git /tmp/ecu
/tmp/ecu/install.sh --project-dir .
rm -rf /tmp/ecu
```

Or manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XeldarAlz/everything-claude-unity.git
cp -r everything-claude-unity/.claude your-unity-project/.claude
chmod +x your-unity-project/.claude/hooks/*.sh
```

### Upgrade / Uninstall

```bash
# Upgrade to latest (preserves your customizations, creates backup)
./upgrade.sh --project-dir .

# Upgrade Codex Desktop marketplace plugin
./upgrade.sh --codex-marketplace

# Preview changes before upgrading
./upgrade.sh --project-dir . --dry-run

# Clean removal (with backup)
./uninstall.sh --project-dir .

# Remove Codex Desktop marketplace plugin
./uninstall.sh --codex-marketplace
```

### Setup Unity MCP (Recommended)

The MCP bridge gives Claude direct control over the Unity Editor — scene building, profiling, builds, and more.

1. In Unity: `Window > Package Manager > + > Add package from git URL`
2. Paste: `https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp.git?path=/MCPForUnity#main`
3. Open `Window > MCP for Unity` and click **Start Server**
4. Claude Code auto-connects via `.claude/settings.json`

### First Run

```bash
cd your-unity-project
claude

# Verify installation:
/unity-doctor         # Check MCP, hooks, project structure

# Start working:
/unity-audit          # Full project health check
/unity-workflow       # Full pipeline: clarify → plan → execute → verify
/unity-prototype      # Rapid prototype a game mechanic
```

## Hooks

22 hooks across 5 lifecycle events, organized by profile level.

### Blocking Hooks — PreToolUse (minimal profile)
| Hook | What It Prevents |
|------|-----------------|
| `block-scene-edit` | Direct text editing of .unity/.prefab YAML (corrupts references) |
| `block-meta-edit` | Editing .meta files (breaks asset GUIDs) |
| `block-projectsettings` | Staging ProjectSettings/ via git (use MCP instead) |
| `guard-editor-runtime` | `UnityEditor` namespace in runtime code without `#if UNITY_EDITOR` |
| `guard-project-config` | Weakening code quality rules (.editorconfig, analyzer settings, .csproj NoWarn) |

### GateGuard — PreToolUse (strict profile)
| Hook | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `gateguard` | Blocks Edit/Write on C# files until the agent has Read them first. Prevents hallucinated changes. For MVS files, suggests reading Model/System counterparts. |

### Quality Hooks — PostToolUse (standard profile)
| Hook | What It Catches |
|------|----------------|
| `warn-serialization` | Field renamed without `[FormerlySerializedAs]` (silent data loss) |
| `warn-filename` | C# file name doesn't match class name (script won't attach) |
| `warn-platform-defines` | `#if UNITY_ANDROID` without `#else` fallback |
| `quality-gate` | GetComponent in Update, LINQ in gameplay, `?.` on Unity objects, uncached Camera.main, SendMessage |
| `validate-commit` | Missing .meta files, code quality issues on commit |
| `suggest-verify` | Suggests `/unity-review` after 5+ C# files modified |
| `build-analyze` | Post-build: shader variant counts, size, stripping issues, deprecated APIs |

### Tracking Hooks — PostToolUse (standard/strict profile)
| Hook | What It Records |
|------|----------------|
| `track-edits` | Files modified during session (standard) |
| `track-reads` | Files read during session — feeds GateGuard (strict) |
| `cost-tracker` | Every tool call with timestamp for session metrics (strict) |

### Session Hooks — SessionStart / Stop
| Hook | Lifecycle | What It Does |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `session-restore` | SessionStart | Restores prior branch, workflow phase, modified files list |
| `session-save` | Stop | Saves session state for next conversation (branch, edits, duration) |
| `stop-validate` | Stop | Runs full-file validation on all C# files modified during session |
| `auto-learn` | Stop | Captures session patterns (MVS breakdown, tool usage, category) to learnings log |
| `notify` | Stop | Sends webhook notification (Discord/Slack) when session exceeds minimum duration |

### Advisory Hooks — PreCompact
| Hook | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `pre-compact` | Saves git state before context compaction |

All hooks support kill switches via environment variables. See [Hook Profiles](#hook-profiles) above.

## MVS Architecture Templates

Templates for the **Model-View-System** pattern with VContainer, MessagePipe, and UniTask:

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `Model.cs.template` | Pure C# data class with `ReactiveProperty<T>` — no Unity dependencies |
| `System.cs.template` | Plain C# class with VContainer constructor injection, `IDisposable` |
| `View.cs.template` | MonoBehaviour observing Model via `Subscribe()`, method injection |
| `LifetimeScope.cs.template` | VContainer composition root with Model/System/View/MessagePipe registration |
| `Message.cs.template` | `readonly struct` for MessagePipe — zero heap allocation |

Plus the original templates: `MonoBehaviour.cs`, `ScriptableObject.cs`, `EditModeTest.cs`, `PlayModeTest.cs`, `AssemblyDefinition.asmdef`.

---

---

## Coding Rules

The toolkit enforces Unity best practices through 5 always-loaded rule files:

- **csharp-unity** — `[SerializeField] private` with `m_` prefix, sealed by default, explicit types
- **performance** — Zero-alloc Update, cache GetComponent, pool objects, no LINQ in gameplay
- **serialization** — `[FormerlySerializedAs]` on renames, `obj == null` not `obj?.`
- **architecture** — MVS pattern, VContainer for DI, MessagePipe for events, UniTask for async
- **unity-specifics** — Editor/Runtime separation, threading, coroutine lifecycle, `?.` danger

---

## Validation Scripts

Run these to check project health:

```bash
./scripts/validate-meta-integrity.sh --all    # Missing/orphaned .meta files, duplicate GUIDs
./scripts/validate-code-quality.sh            # Performance pitfalls in C# code
./scripts/validate-asmdefs.sh                 # Circular assembly definition dependencies
./scripts/detect-missing-refs.sh              # Broken references in scenes/prefabs
./scripts/analyze-build-size.sh               # Build size analysis from Editor.log
./scripts/validate-serialization.sh           # Field renames missing FormerlySerializedAs
./scripts/validate-architecture.sh            # MVS pattern compliance checks
./scripts/generate-claude-md.sh > CLAUDE.md   # Auto-generate project CLAUDE.md
```

## Architecture

### Workflow Pipeline

```
/unity-workflow "add combo scoring"
    │
    ├─ Phase 1: Clarify   ── interview about requirements, constraints, platform
    ├─ Phase 2: Plan      ── scan project, choose agents, present implementation plan
    ├─ Phase 3: Execute   ── route to unity-coder / unity-prototyper / unity-ui-builder
    └─ Phase 4: Verify    ── unity-verifier runs review → auto-fix → re-verify loop
```
