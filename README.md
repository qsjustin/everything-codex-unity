# everything-claude-unity

**The ultimate Claude Code toolkit for Unity game development.**

A production-ready, plug-and-play system that gives Claude Code deep Unity expertise — from writing performant C# to building scenes, profiling performance, and triggering iOS/Android builds — all through natural language.

Built for **solo indie mobile game developers**. Drop it into any Unity project and it works.

## Highlights

### `/unity-workflow` — Full Development Pipeline

A structured 4-phase pipeline for any feature: **Clarify** requirements, **Plan** the implementation, **Execute** with specialized agents, **Verify** with automated review + fix loop.

```
/unity-workflow "add a combo scoring system with multipliers and visual feedback"
```

### `/unity-prototype` — One Prompt to Playable

Describe a mechanic, and Claude writes the C# scripts, builds the scene via MCP, sets up physics layers, configures the camera, and verifies it compiles.

```
/unity-prototype "2D platformer with wall jumping and dash"
```

### Verify-Fix Loop

The `unity-verifier` agent automatically reviews your code changes, fixes safe issues (missing `[FormerlySerializedAs]`, uncached `GetComponent`, `?.` on Unity objects), and re-verifies — up to 3 iterations until clean. Built into `/unity-workflow` and available as an optional step in `/unity-feature` and `/unity-prototype`.

### Hook Kill Switches

All safety hooks support environment variable overrides for power users and CI:

```bash
DISABLE_UNITY_HOOKS=1              # Bypass all hooks
UNITY_HOOK_MODE=warn               # Downgrade blocks to warnings
DISABLE_HOOK_BLOCK_SCENE_EDIT=1    # Disable a specific hook
```

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) installed
- Unity 2021.3 LTS or later
- [unity-mcp](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp) (optional but recommended for full pipeline)

### Install

```bash
# From your Unity project root:
git clone https://github.com/XeldarAlz/everything-claude-unity.git /tmp/ecu
/tmp/ecu/install.sh --project-dir .
rm -rf /tmp/ecu
```

Or manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XeldarAlz/everything-claude-unity.git
cp -r everything-claude-unity/.claude your-unity-project/.claude
chmod +x your-unity-project/.claude/hooks/*.sh
```

### Upgrade / Uninstall

```bash
# Upgrade to latest (preserves your customizations, creates backup)
./upgrade.sh --project-dir .

# Preview changes before upgrading
./upgrade.sh --project-dir . --dry-run

# Clean removal (with backup)
./uninstall.sh --project-dir .
```

### Setup Unity MCP (Recommended)

The MCP bridge gives Claude direct control over the Unity Editor — scene building, profiling, builds, and more.

1. In Unity: `Window > Package Manager > + > Add package from git URL`
2. Paste: `https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp.git?path=/MCPForUnity#main`
3. Open `Window > MCP for Unity` and click **Start Server**
4. Claude Code auto-connects via `.claude/settings.json`

### First Run

```bash
cd your-unity-project
claude

# Verify installation:
/unity-doctor         # Check MCP, hooks, project structure

# Start working:
/unity-audit          # Full project health check
/unity-workflow       # Full pipeline: clarify → plan → execute → verify
/unity-prototype      # Rapid prototype a game mechanic
```

## Safety Hooks

These hooks prevent the most common AI mistakes in Unity projects:

### Blocking (prevents the action)
| Hook | What It Prevents |
|------|-----------------|
| `block-scene-edit` | Direct text editing of .unity/.prefab YAML (corrupts references) |
| `block-meta-edit` | Editing .meta files (breaks asset GUIDs) |
| `block-projectsettings` | Staging ProjectSettings/ via git (use MCP instead) |
| `guard-editor-runtime` | `UnityEditor` namespace in runtime code without `#if UNITY_EDITOR` |

### Warning (alerts but allows)
| Hook | What It Catches |
|------|----------------|
| `warn-serialization` | Field renamed without `[FormerlySerializedAs]` (silent data loss) |
| `warn-filename` | C# file name doesn't match class name (script won't attach) |
| `warn-platform-defines` | `#if UNITY_ANDROID` without `#else` fallback |
| `validate-commit` | Missing .meta files, code quality issues on commit |
| `suggest-verify` | Suggests `/unity-review` after 5+ C# files modified |

All hooks support kill switches via environment variables or `.claude/settings.local.json`. See the [Hook Kill Switches](#hook-kill-switches) section above.

## MVS Architecture Templates

Templates for the **Model-View-System** pattern with VContainer, MessagePipe, and UniTask:

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `Model.cs.template` | Pure C# data class with `ReactiveProperty<T>` — no Unity dependencies |
| `System.cs.template` | Plain C# class with VContainer constructor injection, `IDisposable` |
| `View.cs.template` | MonoBehaviour observing Model via `Subscribe()`, method injection |
| `LifetimeScope.cs.template` | VContainer composition root with Model/System/View/MessagePipe registration |
| `Message.cs.template` | `readonly struct` for MessagePipe — zero heap allocation |

Plus the original templates: `MonoBehaviour.cs`, `ScriptableObject.cs`, `EditModeTest.cs`, `PlayModeTest.cs`, `AssemblyDefinition.asmdef`.

## Coding Rules

The toolkit enforces Unity best practices through 5 always-loaded rule files:

- **csharp-unity** — `[SerializeField] private` with `m_` prefix, sealed by default, explicit types
- **performance** — Zero-alloc Update, cache GetComponent, pool objects, no LINQ in gameplay
- **serialization** — `[FormerlySerializedAs]` on renames, `obj == null` not `obj?.`
- **architecture** — MVS pattern, VContainer for DI, MessagePipe for events, UniTask for async
- **unity-specifics** — Editor/Runtime separation, threading, coroutine lifecycle, `?.` danger

---

## Validation Scripts

Run these to check project health:

```bash
./scripts/validate-meta-integrity.sh --all    # Missing/orphaned .meta files, duplicate GUIDs
./scripts/validate-code-quality.sh            # Performance pitfalls in C# code
./scripts/validate-asmdefs.sh                 # Circular assembly definition dependencies
./scripts/detect-missing-refs.sh              # Broken references in scenes/prefabs
./scripts/analyze-build-size.sh               # Build size analysis from Editor.log
./scripts/validate-serialization.sh           # Field renames missing FormerlySerializedAs
./scripts/validate-architecture.sh            # MVS pattern compliance checks
./scripts/generate-claude-md.sh > CLAUDE.md   # Auto-generate project CLAUDE.md
```

## Architecture

### Workflow Pipeline

```
/unity-workflow "add combo scoring"
    │
    ├─ Phase 1: Clarify   ── interview about requirements, constraints, platform
    ├─ Phase 2: Plan      ── scan project, choose agents, present implementation plan
    ├─ Phase 3: Execute   ── route to unity-coder / unity-prototyper / unity-ui-builder
    └─ Phase 4: Verify    ── unity-verifier runs review → auto-fix → re-verify loop
```

### Agent Interaction

```

    │       │
    │       └──▶ MCP Tools (creates GameObjects, configures components)
    │
    ├──▶ Verifier Agent (reviews changes, auto-fixes, re-verifies)
    │
    ├──▶ Test Agent (writes + runs tests via MCP)
    │
    └──▶ Optimizer Agent (profiles via MCP, fixes bottlenecks)
```

### Hook Safety Net

```
Claude attempts to edit PlayerController.cs
    │
    ├──▶ PreToolUse: guard-editor-runtime.sh checks for UnityEditor usage
    │                 (_lib.sh checks kill switches first)
    │
    ├──▶ [Edit happens]
    │
    └──▶ PostToolUse: warn-serialization.sh checks for field renames
                       warn-filename.sh checks file/class name match
                       suggest-verify.sh tracks edit count
