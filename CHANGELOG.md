# Changelog

All notable changes to everything-claude-unity will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added

**Structured State Management**
- Session state now persists in `.claude/state/` (project-local, git-ignored) instead of `/tmp/`
- Structured `session.json` schema with `schema_version`, `plan`, `verification`, and `agent_context` fields
- Configurable session TTL via `UNITY_SESSION_TTL_HOURS` environment variable (default: 4)
- New `_lib.sh` helpers: `unity_state_read()`, `unity_state_write()`, `unity_state_plan_update()`, `unity_track_warning()`
- State survives system reboots — no more lost session data

**Smart Model Routing**
- New always-loaded `model-routing` skill with complexity heuristics for automatic agent tier selection
- Complexity signals: file count, keywords, scope indicators, risk factors
- `/unity-workflow` Plan phase now evaluates complexity to choose agent tier automatically
- `/unity-team --quick` flag swaps opus agents for sonnet/haiku equivalents
- `/unity-team --security` preset (unity-security-reviewer + unity-reviewer + unity-linter)

**New Agents (5)**
- `unity-scout` (haiku) — fast read-only codebase exploration for scanning before delegation
- `unity-linter` (haiku) — quick validation pass against Unity rules without deep reasoning
- `unity-security-reviewer` (sonnet) — Unity-specific security audit (PlayerPrefs secrets, unencrypted saves, hardcoded keys, insecure network calls)
- `unity-git-master` (sonnet) — Unity-aware git operations (LFS, .meta hygiene, merge strategies, .gitattributes)
- `unity-critic` (opus) — challenges implementation plans before execution (integrated into /unity-workflow)

**New Commands (1)**
- `/unity-skillify` — generates new skills from accumulated session learnings with `--install` flag for auto-placement

**Benchmarking Infrastructure**
- `benchmarks/` directory with runner, evaluator, and scenario framework
- 4 benchmark scenarios: simple-component, serialization-rename, performance-review, multi-system-feature
- `run-benchmarks.sh` with `--compare` flag for version-to-version quality comparison
- Fixture C# files for reproducible evaluation

**Enhanced Learning Pipeline**
- `/unity-learn analytics` subcommand with session time analysis, agent usage, warning hotspots, file hotspots, trends
- `auto-learn.sh` now captures `warnings_fired` from quality-gate and other hooks
- `quality-gate.sh` tracks warnings via `unity_track_warning()` for session analytics
- `/unity-skillify` cross-references existing skills to avoid duplicates

**Notification System Upgrade**
- Multi-channel support via `UNITY_NOTIFY_CHANNELS` JSON env var
- Event types: `session_end`, `build_complete`, `verify_fail`, `cost_threshold`
- OS-native notifications (macOS osascript, Linux notify-send) via `UNITY_NOTIFY_NATIVE=1`
- Rate limiting per channel with configurable interval
- `stop-validate.sh` and `build-analyze.sh` emit notification events
- Backward compatible with existing `UNITY_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` config

**CI Pipeline Hardening**
- Settings-to-hooks cross-validation (every hook reference verified)
- Agent tool restriction validation (haiku/reviewer agents must be read-only)
- C# template syntax validation (balanced braces)
- Skill quality checks (examples, anti-pattern guidance)
- Benchmark scenario JSON validation
- 4 new test files: test-state, test-cross-validation, test-templates, test-skills

**Documentation**
- `docs/HOOK-REFERENCE.md` — comprehensive hook catalog with profiles, kill switches, env vars
- `docs/SKILL-CATALOG.md` — one-page overview of all 41 skills by category
- `docs/BENCHMARK-GUIDE.md` — how to run and create benchmarks
- 5 new README translations: Spanish, Portuguese (BR), German, French, Turkish
- Updated AGENT-GUIDE, ARCHITECTURE, MODEL-ROUTING docs for new agents and features

### Changed

- Session state moved from `/tmp/unity-claude-hooks/` to `.claude/state/` (project-local)
- Session file renamed from `session-state.json` to `session.json` with schema versioning
- Learnings file moved from `.claude/learnings.jsonl` to `.claude/state/learnings.jsonl`
- Pre-compact state moved from `/tmp/` to `.claude/state/`
- `session-restore.sh` uses JSON `saved_at` field instead of `stat` for portable TTL checks
- `install.sh` creates `.claude/state/` directory and adds it to `.gitignore`
- `upgrade.sh` migrates state from old `/tmp/` and `.claude/learnings.jsonl` locations
